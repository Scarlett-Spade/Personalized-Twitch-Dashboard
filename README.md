# TWITCH DASHBOARD

![Twitch Dashboard](Twitch.png)

This is a [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) Project.

Using Next.js, React.js, Twitch API, and Replit Database, I created a personalized Twitch dashboard.
I can pin my favorite Twitch channels and see when the streamers are live. To view the replit, visit https://twitch-dashboard.scarlett-spade.repl.co/.
